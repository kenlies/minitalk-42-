# minitalk
## My hive (42) school project for minitalk

This was a project in which we had to create a simple communication system between a client and a server using PIDs and signals.
There occured a couple of oddities in my evals, but the core principle is correct and it PASSED =D.

First the server must be launched -> it prints its PID & starts listening for signals -> from other terminal: ./client [PID] [MESSAGE] -> enter
Now the server should print the message sent by the client. Supports unicode characters.

- Not the cleanest implementation but it was enough.
